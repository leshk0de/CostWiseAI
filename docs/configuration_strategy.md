# CostWise AI - Configuration Strategy

This document summarizes the updates made to implement a secure and comprehensive configuration strategy for the CostWise AI project.

## Key Changes

1. **Backend Configuration Separation**
   - Removed hardcoded bucket values from `backend.tf` files
   - Created external `backend.hcl.example` templates
   - Updated Terraform init instructions to use `-backend-config=backend.hcl`

2. **Variable Structure Improvement**
   - Organized variables into logical groups
   - Added environment and resource prefix variables
   - Added validation rules for critical variables
   - Expanded configuration for security and API settings

3. **Naming Convention System**
   - Created a centralized naming function in `locals.tf`
   - Implemented environment-aware naming patterns
   - Added random suffix for globally unique resources
   - Applied consistent naming across all resources

4. **Environment-specific Configuration**
   - Enhanced dev, prod environment configurations
   - Added staging environment structure
   - Created environment-specific variable defaults
   - Ensured consistent structure across environments

5. **Secret Management Enhancement**
   - Updated Secret Manager module for dynamic secret naming
   - Added environment prefixes to secrets
   - Improved labeling for resources

6. **Helper Tools**
   - Created `init-environment.sh` script for environment setup
   - Added CI/CD deployment example
   - Enhanced .gitignore for sensitive files

7. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive secure configuration guide
   - Updated README with new deployment instructions
   - Added troubleshooting information for configuration issues

## Implementation Details

### Resource Naming Function

A consistent naming function is now used throughout the codebase:

```hcl
locals {
  # Environment information
  environment     = var.environment
  resource_prefix = var.resource_prefix != "" ? var.resource_prefix : "costwise"
  
  # Naming function for resources
  name_prefix = "${local.resource_prefix}-${local.environment}"
  
  # Resource name generator
  names = {
    dataset           = "${local.name_prefix}-ai-cost-monitoring"
    function_bucket   = "${local.name_prefix}-functions-${random_id.suffix.hex}"
    service_account   = "${local.name_prefix}-sa"
    # ... more resources
  }
}
```

This ensures that resources across environments follow the same naming pattern but remain distinct.

### Configuration Files Structure

For each environment, the configuration files structure is now:

- `terraform.tfvars.example` - Template with placeholders (committed)
- `terraform.tfvars` - Actual values (gitignored)
- `backend.hcl.example` - Backend template (committed)
- `backend.hcl` - Actual backend config (gitignored)

This keeps sensitive values out of version control while providing clear templates for setup.

### Initialization Process

The initialization process has been standardized:

1. Run `./init-environment.sh` to set up the environment
2. Edit the generated configuration files with actual values
3. Initialize Terraform with `terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl`
4. Apply configuration with `terraform apply`

This approach works for both local development and CI/CD pipelines.

## CI/CD Integration

For CI/CD pipelines, the process is:

1. Store secrets in the CI/CD platform's secret storage
2. Generate `terraform.tfvars` and `backend.hcl` dynamically during the pipeline run
3. Use Workload Identity or service account JSON for authentication
4. Initialize and apply Terraform configuration

An example GitHub Actions workflow demonstrates this approach.

## Benefits of the New Strategy

1. **Enhanced Security**: Sensitive values are kept out of version control
2. **Consistency**: All environments follow the same configuration pattern
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new environments or configuration options
4. **CI/CD Friendly**: Works seamlessly with automated deployment pipelines
5. **Maintainability**: Clear organization of variables by purpose
6. **Scalability**: Easy to add new resources or parameters

## Conclusion

The new configuration strategy provides a comprehensive solution for managing environment-specific and sensitive values in a public repository. It follows Terraform best practices while ensuring security and maintainability.
